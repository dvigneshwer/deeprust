# Open-Canvas

## Problem 

Below are few of the problems that we are trying to address with this crate, 

* Onboard and educate poeple from scientific community to Rust 
* There's no stable deeplearning crate in rust-lang
* Not many ML practitioners out there really understand what's going under the hood of these so called popular ML libs out there

## Solution

* Creating a ML crate with a community of data scientists and developers

## Key - Metrics

* Stable implementation of the various machine learning algorithms out there

## Resources required

* Rust-lang programmers
* Researchers possesing knowledge of cutting-edge algorithm
* GPU and hardware setup
* Developemnt & Design 

## Unique value proposition

* Faster Deep learning with rust
* Easy integration to the exisiting stack 
* Ease with people can implement ML algorithms

## User -profiles 

* Researchers
* Data analysts
* Data Engineers
* Data Scientists
* Rust Developers

## User - Channels 

* [Deep-rust Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/dvigneshwer/deeprust)
* [dvigneshwer blog](https://dvigneshwer.github.io/)

## Contributors profiles 

* Rust programmers
* Researchers working on any ML algos
* Managerial profiles 

## Contributor Channels 

* Machine learning conferences
* Word of mouth publicity targeting data scientist & Rust community
